1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/CSPI-QE/firewatch.git`
2. Navigate to the project root: `cd firewatch`
3. Install the necessary dependencies: `make dev-environment`
4. Use the `firewatch` command to execute the tool. See the [CLI usage guide](docs/cli_usage_guide.md) for instructions on using the tool.

## Configuration

### Jira issue creation (`firewatch report`) configuration

Firewatch was designed to allow for users to define which Jira issues get created depending on which failures are found in a OpenShift CI failed run. Using an easy-to-define JSON config, users can easily track issues in their OpenShift CI runs efficiently.

**Example:**

```json
[
  {"step": "exact-step-name", "failure_type": "pod_failure", "classification": "Infrastructure", "jira_project": "PROJECT", "jira_component": "some-component"},
  {"step": "*partial-name*", "failure_type": "all", "classification":  "Misc.", "jira_project": "OTHER"},
  {"step": "*ends-with-this", "failure_type": "test_failure", "classification": "Test failures", "jira_project": "TEST", "jira_epic": "EPIC-123"},
  {"step": "*ignore*", "failure_type": "test_failure", "classification": "NONE", "jira_project": "NONE", "ignore": "true"},
  {"step": "affects-version", "failure_type": "all", "classification": "Affects Version", "jira_project": "TEST", "jira_epic": "EPIC-123", "jira_affects_version": "4.14"}
]
```

#### Defining the Configuration

The firewatch configuration is a list of rules, each rule is defined using 4 values:

- `step`: The exact or partial name of a step in OpenShift CI. Using this value, we can usually determine what may have gone wrong during an OpenShift CI run.
  - For example, say you have multiple steps whose names start with `infra-setup-` and you can confidently say that most of the time, if a run fails during one of these steps, it is probably an infrastructure setup issue. You can define a rule to always file a bug in a specific Jira project so the issue can be addressed. The value in this instance would be something like `infra-setup-*`.
  - The value of this key can be whatever you'd like and can shell-style wildcards in the definition of this key:
    - `*` – matches everything.
    - `?` – matches any single character.
- `failure_type`: The type of failure you'd like issues to be created for. Currently, there are 3 options for this value.
  - `pod_failure`: A failure where the code being executed in the step (OpenShift CI pod) returns a non-zero exit code (when the `passed` value in [`finished.json`](https://docs.prow.k8s.io/docs/metadata-artifacts/) is set to `false`)
  - `test_failure`: A failure where the code being executed in the step produces one or more JUnit files (must have `junit` in the filename) that is in the artifacts (copied into the `$ARTIFACT_DIR`) for the step and any failure is found in the JUnit file(s).
  - `all`: Either a `pod_failure` or a `test_failure`.
- `classification`: How you'd like to classify the issue in Jira. This is not a formal field in Jira, but will be included in the issue description. This is meant to act as a "best-guess" value for why the failure happened.
- `jira_project`: The Jira project you'd like the issue to be filed under.
- `jira_epic`[OPTIONAL]: The epic you would like issues to be added to. **IMPORTANT:** Any epic you use must have the automation user you are using set as a contributor in Jira. For OpenShift CI, the user is `interop-test-jenkins interop-test-jenkins`.
- `jira_component`[OPTIONAL]: The component/components you would like issues to be added to. Must be a comma delimeted string to specify more than one.
- `jira_affects_version`[OPTIONAL]: The version affected by this bug. This will result in the "Affects Version/s" field in Jira to be populated. **IMPORTANT** The version must exist in Jira before adding this value.
- `ignore`[OPTIONAL]: A value that be set to "true" or "false" and allows the user to define `step`/`failure_type` combinations that should be ignored when creating tickets.

The firewatch configuration can be saved to a file (can be stored wherever you want and named whatever you want, it must be JSON though) or defined in the `FIREWATCH_CONFIG` variable. When using the [`report` command](#report---create-jira-issues), if an argument for `--firewatch_config_path` is not provided, the environment variable will be used.

## Usage

### `report`

The `report` command is used to generate and file Jira issues for a failed OpenShift CI run using a [user-defined firewatch configuration](#configuration).
Many of the arguments for this command have set defaults or will use an environment variable.

**Pre-requisites:**

1. A Jira configuration file must exist. Use the `jira_config_gen` command to generate the configuration file.
2. A firewatch config must be defined. Use the [Configuration section above](#configuration) to generate your configuration.

**Arguments:**

```commandline
Usage: firewatch report [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --fail_with_test_failures     Firewatch will fail with a non-zero exit code
                                if a test failure is found.
  --jira_config_path TEXT       The path to the jira configuration file
                                [required]
  --firewatch_config_path TEXT  The path to the firewatch configuration file
  --gcs_bucket TEXT             The name of the GCS bucket that holds
                                OpenShift CI logs  [required]
  --build_id TEXT               The build ID that needs to be reported. The
                                value of $BUILD_ID
  --job_name_safe TEXT          The safe name of a test in a Prow job. The
                                value of $JOB_NAME_SAFE
  --job_name TEXT               The full name of a Prow job. The value of
                                $JOB_NAME
```

**Examples:**

```commandline
# Using all environment variables (Running in OpenShift CI uses this method)
$ export BUILD_ID="some_build_id"
$ export JOB_NAME_SAFE="some_safe_job_name"
$ export JOB_NAME="some_job_name"
$ export FIREWATCH_CONFIG="[{"step": "some-step-name","failure_type":"pod_failure", "classification": "some best guess classification", "jira_project": "PROJECT"}]"
$ firewatch report

# Using CLI arguments
$ firewatch report --build_id some_build_id --job_name_safe some_safe_job_name --job_name some_job_name --firewatch_config_path /some/path/to/firewatch_config.json

# Exit with a non-zero exit code if test failures are found in any JUnit file for a step
$ firewatch report --fail_with_test_failures

```

**How Are Duplicate Bugs Handled?**

This tool take duplicate bugs into consideration. When a failure is identified, after the failure has been matched with its corresponding rule in the firewatch config, the firewatch tool with search Jira for any bugs that match the following rules to determine if it is a duplicate:

- Any OPEN issues that are in the same Jira project defined in the rule's `jira_project` key
- **AND** issues that have a label matching the step/pod name that failed
- **AND** issues that have a label matching the prow job name that failed
- **AND** issues that have a label matching the `failure_type` of the failure we are searching for

If any issues are found that match all the conditions above, we can be fairly confident that the failure may be a duplicate and the tool will make a comment on each of the matching issues that looks like this:

> A duplicate failure was identified in a recent run of the {job name} job:
>
> Link: {link to prow job run}
>
> Build ID: {failing build ID}
>
> Classification: {value of the "classification" key of the matching rule}
>
> Pod Failed: {name of step/pod that failed}
>
> Please see the link provided above to determine if this is the same issue. If it is not, please manually file a new bug for this issue.
>
> This comment was created using firewatch in OpenShift CI

### `jira_config_gen`

The `jira_config_gen` command is used to generate the Jira configuration file used when firewatch interacts with a Jira server.

**Arguments:**

```commandline
Usage: firewatch jira_config_gen [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --output_file TEXT  Where the rendered config will be stored  [required]
  --token_path TEXT   Path to the Jira API token  [required]
  --server_url TEXT   Jira server URL, i.e "https://issues.stage.redhat.com"
                      [required]
  --help              Show this message and exit.
```

**Examples:**

```commandline
# Create a configuration file in the default location (/tmp/jira.config)
$ firewatch jira_config_gen --token_path {Path to file containing Jira API token} --server_url https://some.jira.server.com

# Create a configuration file in a different location (/some/path/jira.config)
$ firewatch jira_config_gen --token_path {Path to file containing Jira API token} --server_url https://some.jira.server.com --output_file /some/path
```
